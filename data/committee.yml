        "Sam is the almighty leader of TEC, we must all bow to him like a god. Sam is really good at the word things and I'm not so I feel like he'll re-write most of these bios, however there is a small chance some of these will be kept for the whole year, I'm ever hopeful."

Hazel, in her spare time, among other things likes to play keep talking and no one explodes, if you don't know what it is you should get it, it's awesome. Together they make sure all our events happen in a timely manner and help Sam in his role."

        "Despite his name Ben doesn't like wood, in fact, he's a history student (probably). He's in charge of all of TEC's equipment and vans and things and makes sure that everything is working properly. In his spare time he likes to dance his heart out in front of a tent full of drunk students, he may have a career lined up as a cage boy."
