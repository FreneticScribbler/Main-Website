Interested in working backstage with sound and lights? Come to our introduction session - we'll be covering the basics on how to use our sound and lighting systems, the essential health and safety information, and our members website.
TEC provide sound and lights to many events throughout the year, ranging from a small open mic to Grad Ball, and you can be part of it. If you're interested in working backstage in live events, this is the place for you. 

Our Kickstart Try-It session is aimed at new members, whether you're brand new to TEC or came in September and want a reminder of the basics. We'll be covering the main areas that we work in on the majority of events, and give you the chance to play with the state-of-the-art kit.

At this session, we'll be covering:

* Lighting training
* Sound training
* Manual handling training
* Basic health and safety training
* And introducing the TEC members website

Once you've attended our introductory session, you can come along to any event that we operate in - and the best part of all is that TEC is entirely free.

There is no experience necessary, and we provide all the training and support both at events and at dedicated training sessions. Plus, coming along doesn't mean you're committing to TEC - come and see if it's for you, we'd love to have you as part of the team.

The session will be in the West Concourse lounge on the C Floor of the Portland Building from 1.30. If you don't know where that is, come to the [TEC Office]({{< relref "contact.md#office" >}}) - also on the C Floor, next to the SU Hub - from 1.00PM and we will take you there.
