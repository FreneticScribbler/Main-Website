title: Try It!

Interested in working on the technical side of events? Come along to one of our try it sessions, where we will introduce you to some of our kit and how to use it. We support a wide variety of events which run throughout the academic year, ranging from a small open mic night to multi venue events such as Graduation Ball.

Our Try-It session is aimed at those with little previous experience, but we welcome those with any level of technical expertise. We will provide you with the training necessary to jump right in and be part of the team. So come along and see what we're all about. 

At this session, we'll be covering:

* Lighting training
* Sound training
* Manual handling training
* Basic health and safety training
* And introducing the TEC members website

Once you've attended our introductory session, you can come along to any event that we operate in - and the best part of all is that TEC is entirely free.

There is no experience necessary, and we provide all the training and support both at events and at dedicated training sessions. Plus, coming along doesn't mean you're committing to TEC - come and see if it's for you, we'd love to have you as part of the team.

The session will be in the West Concourse lounge on the C Floor of the Portland Building from 1.30. If you don't know where that is, come to the [TEC Office]({{< relref "contact.md#office" >}}) - also on the C Floor, next to the SU Hub - from 1.00PM and we will take you there.
