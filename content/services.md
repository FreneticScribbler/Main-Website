# Sound Services
From the smallest pair of speakers on stands, to a 25 kilowatt arena sound system, TEC have the capability to serve a wide variety of venues and audiences, depending on what your event requires.

## PA
Our smaller systems are great for conferences, talks, presentations and recitals in a smaller venue. These speakers can also be turned on their side and used as monitors (foldback) for bands and concerts.

Meanwhile, our larger PA systems can be used in a number of different configurations to provide the sound you want for the venue youâ€™ve got, as loud as you want it (within reason!). We use both the Nexo Alpha and Alpha E lines of PA to find the best configuration for your event and then come along with our amplifiers and control systems to plug it all in and make it happen.
