# Sound Services
From the smallest pair of speakers on stands, to a 25 kilowatt arena sound system, TEC have the capability to serve a wide variety of venues and audiences, depending on what your event requires.

## PA & Amplifiers
Our smaller systems are great for conferences, talks, presentations and recitals in a smaller venue. These speakers can also be turned on their side and used as monitors (foldback) for bands and concerts.

Meanwhile, our larger PA systems can be used in a number of different configurations to provide the sound you want for the venue you’ve got, as loud as you want it (within reason!). We use both the Nexo Alpha and Alpha E lines of PA to find the best configuration for your event and then come along with our amplifiers and control systems to plug it all in and make it happen.

Ranging from 30kg to over 100, our amplifier stock is perfectly suited to our PA stock, many featuring in-house tweaks coupled with custom cabling to allow for every circumstance.

From our Full Alpha Rack and Monitor Rack combinations down to our PS Rack, TEC can meet any requirements in terms of noise, speaker arrangement and power availability.

When receiving a sound package from TEC, the charge for the amplifiers are included with the speakers themselves as a combined cost.

## Multicores
TEC’s multicore system is bespoke to complement our PA system and, much like our PA itself, is available in a number of configurations based on the size of your event. Big festival stage with a big band? You’ll want our large multicore system. Couple of smaller bands? Our small multicore system will be perfect. Featuring up to 48 and 24 inputs respectively, both of our multicores feature harting connectors and XLR fan outs, as well as 8 channels of returns, travelling up to 100m.

At the stage end, we provide a stage box for both multicores as well as satellite boxes to allow for a large stage area. The stage box allows for custom patching, satellite box extensions and even a passive split of the input signal to allow for two control positions.
