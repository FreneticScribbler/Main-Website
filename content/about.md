## History
The University of Nottingham technical committee was founded in the early 1940s, providing technical services to University College Nottingham. TEC then branched out into theatre providing theatrical technical services to the University.

TEC retains a strong alumni network, which each year meets for an annual dinner.

## Our people & training
All members of TEC are trained and experienced volunteers with complete dedication to providing an excellent service to our customers.

Many of our members now work professionally in the events industry.
