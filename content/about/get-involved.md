At TEC, we are always welcoming new members. The easiest way to join is to use the [University of Nottingham Students’ Union website](http://www.su.nottingham.ac.uk/student-media-groups/TEC/).

Our membership is free of charge, and we encourage you to come on as many or as few rigs as you can, providing suitable training and lots of fun. Membership is open exclusively to students of the University of Nottingham, though we do have an extensive network of alumni who, while no longer students, are still members.

If you’d like to join, go to our page on the Students’ Union website and click sign up – it’s free! If you have any questions, either email [info@nottinghamtec.co.uk](mailto:info@nottinghamtec.co.uk), or come into [our office]({{< relref "contact.md#office" >}}) – on the C Floor, Portland Building, University Park Campus.

We hold two New Members’ Introduction sessions each academic year, around Freshers’ and Re-Freshers’ Fair. Of course, you can join any time, but attending these will give you an insight into what TEC is about and provide the necessary initial health & safety training.
