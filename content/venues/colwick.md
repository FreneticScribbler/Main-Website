Colwick is the traditional home of graduation ball, but this is not the only
thing that Colwick is capable of hosting. Weâ€™ve used the marquees and pavilion
to great effect, a range of the events we have done is as follows:

- Graduation Ball
- Formal Dinner
- Strictly Come Dancing
- Hall Sumer Parties
- Charity Dinners
