Colwick Hall and Hotel is a lavish pavilion space with spacious marquee venue to the rear. It's capable of scaling to fit any size of event, with many of the interior venues also being used for the largest of events.

Traditionally, TEC has visited Colwick most notably for University of Nottingham Students' Union Graduation Ball anually in June. To meet the capacity of the graduating students, we also bring in a large external marquee which is placed at the front of the grounds. Dinner is then served in the existing marquee which features acoustic acts and small bands over the meal. Afterwards, the party starts, and has included acts such as Rizzle Kicks, Zane Lowe and Ellie Goulding.

As well as Graduation Ball, we've been to Colwick for charity fundraising events, as well as formal dinners from societies and academic groups across the University and Students' Union. It's a very versatile venue offering its own stage and banquet seating in the rear marquee.
