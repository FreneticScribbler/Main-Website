No Students' Union is complete without its own bar, and the University of Nottingham is no exception. Located on the lower ground floor of the Portland Building, Mooch is a spacious, vibrant venue.

Having recently undergone refurbishment, Mooch is frequently host to open mic nights from various clients, but has also featured some bigger names and branded events in the past.

Throughout the years, names like Bastille and Indiana have performed, as well as Strongbow and NASTA putting their own events on.

Previous work:

- DJ nights (various)
- Oxjam
- Strongbow's Halloween 'Night of the Zombies'
- Students' Union open mic night
- University Radio Nottingham presents Bastille
