Holding up to 13,000 people in both seated or standing configurations, the Ice Arena is the biggest venue TEC works in on a regular basis. 

Throughout the year, the Students' Union hire out the venue for several events, ranging from the smaller-scale (as small as you can get in an arena!) Varsity Ice Hockey to the sell-out Welcome Week Finale.

TEC has worked with many acts in the arena, including Alex Clare, Mista Jam, The Saturdays and Example. We've also used a huge variety of kit, mixing our own with that of other local companies to create a true arena club atmosphere. Most recently, our Mac 250 lighting stock was complimented with ClayPaky Sharpies, and our Nexo Alpha PA in conjunction with Nexo STM created a wonderful sound.

Previous work:

- University Students' Union Varsity series: Basketball, Ice Hockey, and more.
- University Students' Union Welcome Week Finale, 2010-present.
