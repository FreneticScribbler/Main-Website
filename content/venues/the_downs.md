The Downs is an area of grassland measuring over 8 acres in the centre of University Park Campus. Located in the middle of all of the halls of residence, this venue is perfect for attracting anyone living there - as well as anyone working on the campus as it's only a short walk away from the Hallward Library.

From The Downs, there are routes to many areas of campus, whether that be the Sports Centre, Portland Building, or East Midlands Conference Centre. Throughout the years, we've had many clients use The Downs to the best of its ability for their events.

Events can range from a small stage with performance space to a full-blown music festival. The Students' Union held Summer Party for many years, featuring big-name acts such as Example and Ladyhawke. Generally, TEC supplies sound systems for daytime events, such as our 25kW Nexo Alpha PA system for Hindu Society's Holi on the Downs event.

- Holi on the Downs
- Outdoor movie screenings

- University of Nottingham Students' Union Summer Party
