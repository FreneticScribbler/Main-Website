Ranging from the small and intimate libraries and bars of Lincoln or Willoughby Hall, to the vast and open spaces at Jubilee or Sutton Bonington campuses, the halls of residences on campus are great for any event.

Why venture all that way into town when you can have an event to suit your needs just down the stairs, or along the corridor? Our experience working in halls is plentiful, whether it's putting on a film night at Willoughby, an open mic at Cripps, or turning Jubilee or Hugh Stewart into a fully functional, bass-hitting club for the night.

On the tamer side of clubs, we've also helped make awards evenings or hall formals just that bit more special with spotlights and radio mics. Or, bring the first-years out in force with a band or DJ. Just contact us, and we'll work with you to make your hall event exactly what you want.
