Small and intimate spaces, halls of residence offer opportunities for different types of event.
Commonly sound systems and lighting systems are installed for hall dinner parties. But we also do 
band gigs in the hall bars on request. The range of events completed in this venue are as follows:

- Christmas Parties
- Summer Parties
- Formal Dining Events
