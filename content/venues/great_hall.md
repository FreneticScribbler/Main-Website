Appropriately named The Great Hall, it's difficult to find a venue as grand as this across campus. Many of our clients think so too, and we're often back trying new and different things in here.

From an awards evening to a performance night, The Great Hall is as versatile as it is large. While the stage is static, the room layout is quite the opposite, with seating available in banquet or end-on layouts.

With few restrictions in space or power, at TEC we're happy to meet any specification for an event at the Great Hall. That can range from a theatre layout to a club night, or a more corporate series of uplighters along the ornate pillars.
