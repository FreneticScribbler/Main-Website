Donington Hall is an events venue like no other, for it is a castle built in the late 1700s. In 2015, TEC worked closely with the Students' Union to turn it into a Mad Hatter's Tea Party for the Students' Union Graduation Ball.

The Hall's spacious rooms featuring ornate furnishings made for the perfect setting of a few acoustic sets, as well as a relaxation suite down the corridor.

For an event of this size, we also used an extravagant marquee to the rear of the hall. The 500-strong dinner guests took their seats in here at the start of the night, and by the end, the tables were gone and it had turned seamlessly into a dance floor.

Donington is a gorgeous venue, and capable of so many events of different styles.
