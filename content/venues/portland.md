The Portland Building is the heart of the Students' Union of the University of Nottingham. A host to numerous bookable rooms, it has facilities to cope with any event you could throw at it.

Within its walls are rooms perfect for different styles of events. For instance, we've transformed The Hub into a cinema with our 12ft widescreen and HD projector, while The Atrium is ideal for smaller presentations or awards nights.

On the larger scale, TEC has been an integral part to Welcome Fair, which in 2015 took place throughout the corridors of the Portland Building. 

Whether its a few mics for Students' Union Council meetings, a projector and lectern for a presentation, or a dozen moving lights and hundreds of kilograms of speakers, we're capable of making any event happen - plus our office is here, so we're a little bit biased!
