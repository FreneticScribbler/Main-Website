A band and disco space in Portland which has recently been transformed into a
performance space and multifunctional mingling space. We’ve worked in both the
old and new space, making it work for a variety of events both formal and
informal. A short list of some of the events we have done are as follows:

- Prizes and Awards
- Band gigs – classical/brass/rock
- Awards Evenings
- Talent Shows
- Film Showings
