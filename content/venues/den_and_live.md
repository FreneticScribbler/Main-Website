The Studio Live, previously known as The Den, is a purpose-built band, disco and performance space located on the lower ground floor of the Portland Building. Its central location makes it easy to access from any area of University Park campus, and is perfect distance from other Students' Union amenities.

Studio Live features both retractable seating and stage, and can be used in any configuration so can cater for almost any event. TEC has been involved heavily in the upgrade of the space, so we're keen to use it in new and exciting ways.

The venue is suitable for a range of events, varying in formality. This can range from an open mic night to a black tie awards dinner, and we've helped with them all.

Next door, The Studio, a multifunctional mingling space which is perfect to use as a reception foyer, mingling space, or even a separate venue entirely. By day, The Studio is an unassuming space, we can turn it into whatever space you're looking for.
