This spacious venue on King's Meadow Campus is around a mile from the main University Park campus, but a mere stone's throw from our own storeroom.

TEC have a wealth of experience working in Studio 7, whether that's building a black box theatre for a dance show with the Students' Union's dance troupe - NUDance - or instead supporting the Students' Union sports teams with their Sports Ball. Whether it's an awards dinner, play, or club night you're after, Studio 7 is capable of it all.


Hosting over 100 independently controlled TV pantographs to fly lighting fixtures, as well as 8,000sqft (approx 27sqm) of floor space to put up any structures you see fit, there's plenty of room for us to create just about any effect.


Studio 7 can hold up to 500 people arranged in many ways: proscenium, round and banquet have all been done to great success, and some even use the retractable bleacher seating which can accommodate 230 people.
