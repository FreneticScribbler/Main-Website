This is an in-depth look at what we do in Studio 7, Maybe some more images here 

Or maybe even a slideshow

We could even put something over there ->

Or maybe up there ^ (maybe)

I don't know, just some ideas

Maybe a button that goes back to:

<a href="/venues"><button class="btn blue waves-effect waves-dark">venues</button></a>

or a link that <a href="/venues">does the same thing</a>
