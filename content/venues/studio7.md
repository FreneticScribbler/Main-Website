One of the venues we are most comfortable in, we’ve been able to transform
this space into formats and orientations. Due to the large space available both
in terms of floor space and ceiling height, this venue can be used to build and
light a wide variety of events. Some of the events we have done in Studio 7
previously are:

- Formal Dinners
- Dance Shows
- Talent Shows
- Fashion Shows
