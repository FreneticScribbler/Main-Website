## TEC Discounts

Discounts will be offered on a per-event basis and cannot be guaranteed.

For the 2016 calendar year, following sponsorship from the Impact Campaign, TEC PA and Lighting will be supporting Breast Cancer Research by offering a discount on events supporting this cause.

To qualify, event contacts should sell tickets or fundraise during the event, and consent to being contacted by a representative from the Impact Campaign for further discussions and publicity.

The Breast Cancer Research discount is available for all events where the event lands between the start of term - Monday 26th September, 2016 - and 31st December 2016.

TEC PA and Lighting will offer a discount of 50%, or Â£200 (ex. VAT), whichever is lower. The discount will be from TEC's own equipment, and will not include any equipment that is hired in for the event.
